# Vault TDD

This is a simple example of using Test Driven Development by following a example given in a french video on TDD ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_M89PhfHO0 ) a bit modified in my own way.

The goal here is to show what TDD should be and what it can do on a simple example.

# Getting Started

```
npm i
npm run test
```
